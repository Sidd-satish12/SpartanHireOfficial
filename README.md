## Inspiration

We built **SpartanHire** because job hunting feels like a part-time job nobody signed up for. Students juggle classes, projects, and existential dread, leaving little room to figure out what skills they actually need. We thought, "What if we made job prep less overwhelming and more like a to-do list you’d actually enjoy checking off?"

## What it does

**SpartanHire** takes your resume or a job description, figures out what skills you’re missing, and turns them into a 7-day learning sprint. It’s like having a career coach, but cheaper and less judgy. Plus, we added a productivity timer with friendly nudges to keep you on track because we know the struggle is real.

## How we built it

We slapped together a Chrome extension with **React.js** for the front-end jazz and **Node.js** + **Express.js** to handle the backend magic. **MongoDB** keeps user data cozy and safe. For the brainy stuff, we plugged into **OpenAI's GPT-4 API** to analyze resumes and job descriptions because AI is cool and we're not about to do that manually.

## Challenges we ran into

- Making AI understand that “proficient in Excel” doesn’t mean “Excel wizard.”
- Fighting time zones, caffeine crashes, and mysterious bugs that only show up at 3 AM.
- Juggling feature creep while reminding ourselves, "It’s a hackathon, not a startup launch."

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- It works! (Mostly.)
- We got AI to create useful learning plans instead of philosophical rants.
- Built a productivity tool that we’d actually use ourselves.

## What we learned

- AI is smart, but you still need to babysit it.
- Simplicity beats overengineering, especially at 4 AM.
- Communication is key unless you like merge conflicts.

## What's next for SpartanHire

- **Skill Analytics:** Fancy charts to feel productive while procrastinating.
- **Resource Suggestions:** Like Clippy, but for job prep.
- **Peer Accountability:** Because suffering is better with friends.
- **Mobile App:** For productivity on the go (or pretending to be productive).

The goal? Make job hunting suck less.
